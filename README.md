# CryptoClustering Project

## Overview

This project was a hands-on exploration of how to handle data and apply K-means clustering to classify cryptocurrencies based on their price fluctuations across various timeframes. By completing this project, I gained a deeper understanding of the K-means algorithm, the process of determining the optimal number of clusters (k), and how principal component analysis (PCA) can be used to optimize clustering.

## Project Objective

In this challenge, the primary goal was to classify cryptocurrencies according to their price changes over different intervals, including 24 hours, 7 days, 30 days, 60 days, 200 days, and 1 year. The project involved the following key steps:

1. **Data Preparation:** Load and preprocess the cryptocurrency market data.
2. **K-means Clustering:** Apply the K-means algorithm to the original data and the PCA-transformed data.
3. **Elbow Method:** Determine the optimal number of clusters (k) using the elbow method.
4. **PCA Optimization:** Reduce the feature dimensions using PCA and assess how this impacts clustering.
5. **Feature Weight Analysis:** Analyze the influence of each feature on the principal components.

## Conclusion

This project provided a comprehensive and practical understanding of K-means clustering and PCA. By working through the steps of clustering cryptocurrencies and optimizing the process with PCA, I now have a more profound grasp of how these techniques can be applied to real-world data, particularly in the context of financial market analysis.
